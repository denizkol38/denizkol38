My love for the software world, my love of learning and my belief in always surpassing myself define me. It excites me to produce innovative solutions, to follow technological developments closely and to give life to these innovations in my projects.

💻 Thanks to my computer science education and part-time work in the software industry, I gained the ability to approach problems from an analytical perspective and learnt to create solutions that make users' work easier. I have built a wide portfolio of knowledge and skills by working with different platforms and technologies.

👯 My self-confidence and willingness to continuously learn have helped me quickly adapt to new technologies and continuously improve my projects. At the same time, I care a lot about teamwork, take care to communicate effectively with my teammates in projects and enjoy celebrating successes together.

👩‍💻 In my free time, I read technology blogs, contribute to open source projects, and develop small projects to experiment with new languages and technologies. I also enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking in nature and taking photos.

🙂 Software development is not only a profession for me, but also a passion and a lifestyle. I approach every project with great enthusiasm, contribute creative ideas and enjoy the joy of collaboration. I look forward to being part of a company that produces successful projects and grows with its team. If I have the opportunity to work with you, you can be sure that I will do my best to move your company forward with my experience and skills.
